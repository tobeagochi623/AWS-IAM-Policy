# IAM AWS
# Create IAM users and add them to IAM groups, along with permission policies, to provide access to various services in the AWS account


In this screenshot, I created an IAM user named Sarah in AWS and giving her access to the AWS Management Console. Here’s what each part means: User Name (Sarah): I created a new user named Sarah. This user will have specific permissions depending on the policies and groups they are associated with. Provide user access to the AWS Management Console (Optional): I chose to give Sarah access to the AWS Management Console, which allows her to log in to AWS through the web interface. Console Password (Custom Password): I selected the option to create a custom password for Sarah. This gives me control over what the initial password will be, rather than having AWS auto-generate one. “Users must create a new password at next sign in”: By checking this box I am enforcing a security measure that requires Sarah to change her password upon her first login. This is good practice for ensuring that users set their own secure passwords after their account is created.

Review and Create stage of creating the IAM user, I added tags to the user account. Tags (Optional): Tags are key-value pairs that you can assign to IAM users, groups, roles, or resources in AWS. Tags help with organizing, managing, and identifying resources easily, especially in large environments. They are also useful for things like cost tracking or grouping resources based on teams or projects. Key (Dev-Team): This is the name of the tag. In this case, I chose “Dev-Team” as the key, which likely represents a development team in the organization. Value (Developers): This is the value for the “Dev-Team” tag. By setting the value to “Developers”, I’m indicating that this IAM user belongs to the development team. So, the tag you created helps identify that the user Sarah is part of the Dev-Team and works as a Developer. Tags can later be used for filtering or applying specific policies and permissions.
