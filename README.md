# IAM AWS
# Create IAM users and add them to IAM groups, along with permission policies, to provide access to various services in the AWS account


In this screenshot, I created an IAM user named Sarah in AWS and giving her access to the AWS Management Console. Here’s what each part means: User Name (Sarah): I created a new user named Sarah. This user will have specific permissions depending on the policies and groups they are associated with. Provide user access to the AWS Management Console (Optional): I chose to give Sarah access to the AWS Management Console, which allows her to log in to AWS through the web interface. Console Password (Custom Password): I selected the option to create a custom password for Sarah. This gives me control over what the initial password will be, rather than having AWS auto-generate one. “Users must create a new password at next sign in”: By checking this box I am enforcing a security measure that requires Sarah to change her password upon her first login. This is good practice for ensuring that users set their own secure passwords after their account is created.

Review and Create stage of creating the IAM user, I added tags to the user account. Tags (Optional): Tags are key-value pairs that you can assign to IAM users, groups, roles, or resources in AWS. Tags help with organizing, managing, and identifying resources easily, especially in large environments. They are also useful for things like cost tracking or grouping resources based on teams or projects. Key (Dev-Team): This is the name of the tag. In this case, I chose “Dev-Team” as the key, which likely represents a development team in the organization. Value (Developers): This is the value for the “Dev-Team” tag. By setting the value to “Developers”, I’m indicating that this IAM user belongs to the development team. So, the tag you created helps identify that the user Sarah is part of the Dev-Team and works as a Developer. Tags can later be used for filtering or applying specific policies and permissions.

This screenshot is me creating a new user. I did create multiple users. This user is going to a different group.

User Groups: User groups in AWS IAM are collections of users. They allow you to assign permissions to multiple users at once by applying policies to the group. This way, you don’t need to individually manage permissions for each user. Group Name (Dev-Team): I named the group Dev-Team, which suggests that this group is intended for members of the development team. Selecting Users: I selected two users from the available user list to be part of the Dev-Team group. By adding users to this group, these users will inherit the permissions associated with the group. It simplifies permission management for everyone in the group. By creating this group, any permissions or policies I attach to the Dev-Team group will apply to all its members, making it easier to manage their access to AWS services.

I attached permission policies to the Dev-Team user group. Here’s what that means: Permission Policies: These are predefined or custom sets of permissions that determine what actions users or groups can perform on AWS resources. By attaching permission policies to a user group, all users in that group will inherit those permissions. AWS has a large number of managed policies (948 in this case) that you can choose from. I selected 2 permission policies to grant specific access to the members of the Dev-Team group. By attaching these policies, the users in the Dev-Team group will have access to the services and actions allowed by the selected policies.

I created the HR-Team user group and added two users from the list. This is just like what I did for the Dev-Team. By putting people in a group, I can manage their permissions all at once. After adding them to the HR-Team, whatever permission policies I attach to this group will apply to those two users.

 In AWS, when I create a group, I can attach permission policies to it. These policies control what actions members of the group can perform. By assigning a policy to the HR-Team, I made sure everyone in that group automatically gets the permissions defined in that policy. It’s a simple way to manage access for multiple people at once instead of doing it for each user individually.

The last screenshot shows the two user groups I created: Dev-Team and HR-Team. The Dev-Team has two users, and the HR-Team also has two users. By using these groups, I can easily manage permissions for both teams without having to set up individual permissions for each person.” That’s a great way to keep things organized and efficient in AWS!
