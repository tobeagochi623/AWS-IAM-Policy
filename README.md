# IAM AWS
# Create IAM users and add them to IAM groups, along with permission policies, to provide access to various services in the AWS account


In this screenshot, I created an IAM user named Sarah in AWS and giving her access to the AWS Management Console. Here’s what each part means: User Name (Sarah): I created a new user named Sarah. This user will have specific permissions depending on the policies and groups they are associated with. Provide user access to the AWS Management Console (Optional): I chose to give Sarah access to the AWS Management Console, which allows her to log in to AWS through the web interface. Console Password (Custom Password): I selected the option to create a custom password for Sarah. This gives me control over what the initial password will be, rather than having AWS auto-generate one. “Users must create a new password at next sign in”: By checking this box I am enforcing a security measure that requires Sarah to change her password upon her first login. This is good practice for ensuring that users set their own secure passwords after their account is created.
